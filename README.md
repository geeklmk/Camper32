# Camper32

Small personal project running on a ESP32 board (NodeMCU devkit) aiming to replace the old electronic of a Laika Ecovip 4 caravan.

# Project aim
The idea is to:
- Operate the light and water pump switch, using two solid state relais
- Manager the water heater settings (50° and 70°) as well as the water heater feedback (getting signals from the two leds)
- Read the status of the two water tanks
- Read the status of the solar panel/charger as well as battery status
- Use a Nextion touch screen display as interface
